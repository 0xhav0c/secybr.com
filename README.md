# who am i?

In the cyber security sector, which I started as a hobby in 2009, I have been continuing as a senior penetration tester for two years. I took part in penetration tests of many public institutions and private institutions/organizations. As part of the Red Team service, I constantly created and implemented Red Team scenarios and reported them. I performed L7 L4 type DoS-DDoS tests.

I prepared documents for myself for the researchers I did and the situations I encountered during the penetration test & red teaming. I wanted to share these documents with you on a blog.

With this blog, I will provide you with:

- To provide methods and methodologies that can assist during penetration testing & red teaming.
- Real life scenarios about logical vulnerabilities.
- Installation and demos of tools I find useful.

I'm totally open to your constructive comments and criticisms.
