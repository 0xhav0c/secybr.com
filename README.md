# who am i?

I have been continuing as a senior penetration tester for two years in the cyber security sector, which I started as a hobby in 2009. I took part in penetration tests of many public and private institutions/organizations. My skills include constantly creating and implementing Red Team scenarios, L7-L4 type DoS-DDoS analysis and Network security.

I prepared documents for myself for the research I did and the situations I encountered during the penetration test & red teaming. I wanted to share these documents with you on a blog.

With this blog, I will provide you with:

- To provide methods and methodologies that can assist during penetration testing & red teaming.
- Real life scenarios about logical vulnerabilities.
- Installation and demos of tools I find useful.

I'm totally open to your constructive comments and criticisms.
