# What is VNC?

It is a cross-platform screen sharing system that was created to remotely control another computer. This means that a computer’s screen, keyboard, and mouse can be used from a distance by a remote user from a secondary device as though they were sitting right in front of it.

VNC works on a client/server model. A server component is installed on the remote computer (the one you want to control), and a VNC viewer, or client, is installed on the device you want to control from. This can include another computer, a tablet, or a mobile phone. When the server and viewer are connected, the server transmits a copy of the remote computer’s screen to the viewer.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE               VERSION
5900/tcp open  vnc                   VNC (protocol 3.3)
```

<h3>Decrypting VNC Password</h3>

Default password is stored in: `~/.vnc/passwd`{: .filepath}.

> exiIf you have the VNC password and it looks encrypted (a few bytes, like if it could be and encrypted password). It is probably ciphered with `3des`. You can get the clear text password using `vncpwd`.
