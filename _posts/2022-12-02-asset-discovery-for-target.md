# Finding Netblock Addres From Company Name

You can find [NetblockTool](https://github.com/NetSPI/NetblockTool) on Github.

```shell
#NetblockTool
#Simple run. Get results from Google dorking and ARIN database:
python3 NetblockTool.py Company
#Include the verbose flag to print status updates:
python3 NetblockTool.py -v Company
#Extract netblocks owned by your target companyâ€™s subsidiaries:
python3 NetblockTool.py -v Company -s
#Extract point of contact information:
python3 NetblockTool.py -v Company -p
#Get as much information as possible, including netblocks found using wildcard queries, points of contact, geolocation data, and physical addresses:
python3 NetblockTool.py -wpgav Company -so
```

# Finding Assets From IP Databases

## Finding IP Address From SSL Certificates on Censys.io

You can use [censys.io](https://search.censys.io) as one of the fast and creative solutions for detecting IP addresses. With this method, by searching the domain name in the SSL certificates in the [Censys.io](http://censys.io/) database, you can obtain all the addresses that the target domain name is passing through.

Or you can use this command. But firstly, you have to install python-censys libary. You can install from [here](https://github.com/censys/censys-python).

```shell
python3 -m censys search ' services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject.common_name: "example.com"' --index-type hosts | jq -c '.[] | {ip: .ip}' > ip.txt
#You can pars output with this command
sed -i 's/[^0-9,.]*//g' ip.txt
```

## Finding Organization ASN & Netblock IP Address with BGP

You can find out the Autonomous System Number (ASN) number by searching the keywords of the Organization through the application of BGP [here](https://bgp.he.net).

# Finding Netblock IP Address CIDR with nslookup & whois

With the Whois information, a lot of information about the domain name can be accessed. Our goal in this technique is to detect Netblock and CIDR addresses to expand the attack surface. For this, after the address is detected with the help of nslookup, a whois query is sent to this address and the Netblock and CIDR to which this IP address belongs are detected.  

> In order to expand the attack surface as much as possible in the target organization, we first need the domain and subdomain addresses. Before applying this method, you should collect as many domains and subdomains as possible.
