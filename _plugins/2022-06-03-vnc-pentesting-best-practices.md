# What is VNC?

It is a cross-platform screen sharing system that was created to remotely control another computer. This means that a computerâ€™s screen, keyboard, and mouse can be used from a distance by a remote user from a secondary device as though they were sitting right in front of it.

VNC works on a client/server model. A server component is installed on the remote computer (the one you want to control), and a VNC viewer, or client, is installed on the device you want to control from. This can include another computer, a tablet, or a mobile phone. When the server and viewer are connected, the server transmits a copy of the remote computerâ€™s screen to the viewer.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE               VERSION
5900/tcp open  vnc                   VNC (protocol 3.3)
```

## VNC Credentials

## Decrypting VNC Password

Default password is stored in: `~/.vnc/passwd`

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ exiIf you have the VNC password and it looks encrypted (a few bytes, like if it could be and encrypted password). It is probably ciphered with 3des. You can get the clear text password using vncpwd.
